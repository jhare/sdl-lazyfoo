My implementation/walkthrough of this huge SDL tutorial.

I type this shit.

[lazyfoo SDL tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php)

You'll need for lesson6
* `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image`
* `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev`

Some other useful linker flags, also managed by apt
* `-lSDL2_image`
* `-lSDL2_ttf`
* `-lSDL2_mixer`
